### 🧩 2.1 Clarification on Derivative Works (New in 1.2)

To avoid ambiguity, KSL distinguishes between two categories of “derivation”:

1. **Open Derivation**
   This includes, but is not limited to: summaries, cross-language translations, visual adaptations, teaching materials, commentaries, explanatory videos, creative dialogues, etc.
   Such derivative works **do not require additional authorization**, provided that the author’s name and original semantic attribution are retained.

2. **Structural Derivation / Semantic Extension**
   Any work that takes the **core theoretical structures** covered by this license (e.g., the Semantic Universe Tower, conditions of semantic freedom, encapsulation adjudication logics, etc.) as a foundation to **extend, modularize, redesign application logic, generate reasoning mechanisms, or develop into an independent theoretical system**
   **requires prior authorization from the author**, in order to preserve the stability and clarity of the original semantic framework.

---

## 3. Restrictions

Without prior written authorization, the following acts are strictly prohibited:

* Using the contents of this work, or its key terminologies/structures, in **commercial software, SaaS, closed-source services, or profit-oriented products**;

* Licensing, reselling, or sublicensing works based on the Koun theories **without explicit authorization from the author**.

---

## 4. Terminology and Semantic Locus Statement

* The **core terminologies** covered by this license (e.g., semantic node, semantic tension, KounGraph, semantic convergence, counter-cause, etc.) are original theoretical inventions;
* Users must respect the existing definitions of these terms and may not appropriate them in contexts that diverge substantially from their original meaning;
* All terminologies may be regarded as **semantic loci**, possessing origin-based and semantic ownership attributes.

## 8. AGI and Institutional Application Acknowledgment Clause (New)

1. **Acknowledgment Obligation**
   Any implementation of **AGI, commercial applications, institutional designs, or governance frameworks** that incorporates the Koun-U Theory must explicitly acknowledge Koun-U Theory as its foundational theoretical framework.

2. **Transmissibility**
   This acknowledgment obligation is **transmissible**: any secondary or subsequent applications built upon such implementations must also clearly acknowledge Koun-U Theory as their foundational source.

3. **Attribution Recommendation**
   In public documents, publications, patents, or product descriptions, it is **recommended** that contributor lists or acknowledgments explicitly state:
   “Based on Koun-U Theory, Author: Shu Koun.”

---

⚖️ **Note:** This version strikes a balance — acknowledgment of Koun-U Theory is mandatory, while inclusion of “Shu Koun” in contributor lists is strongly recommended but not enforced, ensuring legal robustness without over-restrictiveness.
