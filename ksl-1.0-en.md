### 🧩 2.1 Clarification on Derivative Works (New in 1.2)

To avoid ambiguity, KSL distinguishes between two categories of “derivation”:

1. **Open Derivation**
   This includes, but is not limited to: summaries, cross-language translations, visual adaptations, teaching materials, commentaries, explanatory videos, creative dialogues, etc.
   Such derivative works **do not require additional authorization**, provided that the author’s name and original semantic attribution are retained.

2. **Structural Derivation / Semantic Extension**
   Any work that takes the **core theoretical structures** covered by this license (e.g., the Semantic Universe Tower, conditions of semantic freedom, encapsulation adjudication logics, etc.) as a foundation to **extend, modularize, redesign application logic, generate reasoning mechanisms, or develop into an independent theoretical system**
   **requires prior authorization from the author**, in order to preserve the stability and clarity of the original semantic framework.

---

## 4. Terminology and Semantic Locus Statement
